\section{Logical path to accomplishing scope}

This project has two primary tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item developing an open, collaborative benchmark framework allowing real
  inter-code comparison, and
\item using this framework to understand what modeling fidelity is required to
  ensure the robustness of conclusions for different fuel cycle scenarios.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Relevance and Outcomes/Impacts}

This project represents a first attempt to provide a comprehensive basis for
the validation of \gls{NFCS} tools.  There has been a lot of interest in such
tools for over a decade, serving various roles in improving the understanding
of our nuclear energy future.  Nevertheless, substantial effort must be
invested to establish confidence in the results each time such a tool is used
for an important analysis.  This is in contrast to other forms of simulation
in nuclear energy research, for which many tools are considered robust and
experience widespread confidence.  Rigorous validation is inherently
challenging for \gls{NFCS} tools, this proposal will create a framework for
building confidence in the abscence of rigorous validation.  While probably
not the ``last word'' on \gls{NFCS} confidence, it will provide an important
basis for the community to extend upon in future efforts.
